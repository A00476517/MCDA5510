Name: Vrushali Savankumar Prajapati
Place: India
I am a software developer and previously I was working on one web application for online interview process. Basically, this web application allows us to give online examination and we have integrated few AI proctoring features in it. Detect face motion features was one of our major points and it was totally depending on the large data of face points and we continuously have to analyse those data and I found it very interesting. So that's the reason I am here in this course. So that I can learn data science concepts and I can serve it with my previous experience on software development.

If I talk about the similarity with my team mates then me and Kritika are front end developers and we are working on a same technology while with Lilian, we both were late in college so we did all the pending works together.
